The **Paty** program is our flagship pathway that blends studio-based learning with deep community immersion.

### Three things define Paty

- **Context-first research** with local communities.
- **Mentor squads** spanning product, design, policy, and governance.
- **Public showcases** broadcasting progress every sprint.

Participants also get access to fractional residency in our new FutureStack lab where they can collaborate with partners or spin off climate ventures.

Stay tuned for the 2026 cohort themes ranging from climate resilient agriculture to AI policy toolkits.
