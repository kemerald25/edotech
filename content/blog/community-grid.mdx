When we started the Community Grid initiative we knew the brand had to feel **futuristic yet human**. Our solution leans on glassmorphism, grid overlays, and subtle parallax cues.

### Accessibility anchors

1. Motion-safe toggles for reduced motion users.
2. Text contrasts above AA even on gradient surfaces.
3. Voice-ready tokens for kiosk deployments.

> The Grid is less about pixels and more about how Edo technologists feel when they connect to resources.

We're now scaling the system into the Edo Tech mobile app and festival experiences.
