Edo Tech Community has spent the last year embedding **AI civic labs** inside local councils. Each lab pairs a designer, an engineer, and a policy champion to rewire service delivery.

<Callout type="success">
  Civic lab pilots have saved 1,240 staff hours across ministries this year.
</Callout>

## What makes the lab model work?

1. **Shared briefs** sourced from community assemblies.
2. **Transparent data rooms** built on open standards.
3. **Rapid experimentation** with weekly showcases to the public.

> We are ushering a new era where Edo residents co-own the roadmap.

Expect upcoming deep dives into identity wallets, clean-mobility telemetry, and the tools we open-sourced to get there.
